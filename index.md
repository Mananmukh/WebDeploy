    <p>
      I am a full-time Postdoctoral Researcher (CIHR) in Public Health Sciences at Queen’s University, where I work at the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, and population health. My research is motivated by real-world health questions and focuses on developing methods that are both statistically rigorous and practically useful. I develop interpretable and scalable machine learning and AI models for longitudinal health data, multimodal exposure profiles, and wearable sensor analytics. Much of my work involves complex, high-dimensional data where transparency and scientific meaning are just as important as predictive performance.
 <p>
A central component of my research is causal modeling. I apply methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation, longitudinal mediation frameworks, and latent factor models to study child nutrition, physical activity, early-life exposures, and long-term health outcomes. I am particularly interested in how causal inference tools can be integrated with modern machine learning to generate insights that are robust, interpretable, and policy-relevant.

<p>
My research spans exposome analysis, pediatric adiposity and respiratory health, and patient-level risk stratification. I have published first-author work in the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics and the IEEE Internet of Things Journal, alongside collaborative publications in the European Respiratory Journal and PLOS ONE.
 <p>
Prior to my postdoctoral work, I gained industry experience at Novartis, where I worked on regulatory-compliant clinical trial analytics. That experience continues to shape how I think about reproducibility, documentation, and decision-oriented statistical modeling.
 <p>
Technically, I work primarily in R, Python, SAS, and SQL, and I frequently use high-performance computing environments for large-scale modeling.
 <p>
I am broadly interested in applying AI and statistical science to real-world health and policy problems and am always open to collaborations in machine learning, causal inference, and data-driven public health research.
