    <p>
      I work at the intersection of <strong>biostatistics</strong>, <strong>interpretable machine learning</strong>,
      and <strong>method development</strong> for longitudinal and high dimensional data, with applications to
      exposome and child health, pulmonary outcomes, and wearable sensors.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Public Health Sciences at Queen’s University.
      I collaborate on CIHR supported work on early life exposome profiles and atopic outcomes, and on methodological
      evaluations of longitudinal spirometry modeling strategies to improve risk factor epidemiology and trial efficiency.
